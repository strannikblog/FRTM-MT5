#### Version 1.1 (2025-11-16 12:05) - Static Override Implementation
**Changes Made:**
- Created RiskManager_v1.54_StaticOverride.mq5 with dual-protection risk management
- Added Static Override system with configurable drawdown thresholds:
  - DD < 5%: No restriction (full dynamic range available)
  - 5% ≤ DD < 7%: MAX risk capped at 1.0%
  - 7% ≤ DD < 10%: MAX risk capped at 0.5% (emergency mode)
  - DD ≥ 10%: Trading halted (0.0% risk)
- Enhanced state structure with Static Override tracking variables
- Implemented ApplyStaticOverride() function for real-time risk capping
- Updated display to show both dynamic and final risk levels
- Added Static Override status indicator in main panel
- Enhanced transaction logging with drawdown and static cap information
- Integrated Static Override into all risk management functions
- Updated CSV state format to include new Static Override fields
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing features

**Files Affected:**
- RiskManager_v1.54_StaticOverride.mq5 (created)

**Reason for Change:**
Implementation of professional-grade dual-protection risk management system combining consecutive loss-based dynamic risk reduction with drawdown-based static override for comprehensive account protection.

#### Version 1.2 (2025-11-16 12:15) - Static Override Display Fix
**Changes Made:**
- Fixed display logic showing confusing arrow and dynamic level information
- Removed incorrect "Level: MID (1.0%) → 2.0% ⬆️" display
- Static Override now works silently in background showing only final risk level
- Maintained original display behavior: "Level: MID (1.0%)" format
- Level text still based on dynamic risk percent (correct behavior)
- Risk percentage shows final capped risk level
- Static Override status shown separately in dedicated line

**Files Affected:**
- RiskManager_v1.55_StaticOverride_Fixed.mq5 (created)

**Reason for Change:**
User feedback identified confusing display behavior. Static Override should apply caps silently without showing uncapped risk levels, maintaining clean user interface consistent with original design principles.
